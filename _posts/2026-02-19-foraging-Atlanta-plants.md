title: "Compilation of useful plants in the Atlanta area"
---
Urban areas might seem at first to be poor in foraging opportunities, but they actually provide a lot of advantages over
rural areas if you know where to look. This is not a complete list of edibles I have found in the Atlanta area, this is 
a list of what I think is worth your time. 
## Plants
### Trees and Bushes
**White Mulberry**
These are fast-growing trees which were planted in the United States to feed silkworms. The industry never took off,
but the invasive trees are now everywhere. While mulberries are not the most flavorful wild fruit, their sheer abundance
makes them worth looking for. The leaves have the interesting characteristic of having 3 different shapes on one tree, a
trait this tree only has in common with sasafras, which is also an edible known for its root beer scented roots. Mulberry leaves
will be rough and sasafras leaves smooth. Look for fruit which looks like a long blackberry hanging from trees in June.
**American Persimmon**
**Serviceberry**
**Pawpaw**
**Crabapple**
**Blueberry**
**Spicebush**

### Vines
**Southern Dewberry**
Blackberies are not always vines. Many species of plant in the genus Rubus are blackberries. A specific type of blackberry,
the Southern Dewberry, has been my favorite species to forage. It is abundant and has juicy fruits. 
It trails along the ground and can be scouted out in March — look for white flowers and red brambles. It is ready to harvest in May.

**Purple Passionflower**
This is a close relative of the familiar purple and orange passion fruit. Look for its wacky purple flowers throughout summer
and its fruit in late summer and early autumn. It is a vine that I usually find low to the ground with three-pronged leaves.
I found a lot in August, and I took them home to ripen because the vine they were growing on had been chopped down. Some of them ripened.

**Muscadine**
These are grapes with a thick skin and seeds, and eating them is an experience unlike supermarket grapes. They are very flavorful
with a sour skin that most spit out and a sweet interior. Be warned, I have experienced mild throat itching after eating a lot of them.
They are abundant in forests, and the vines can get quite large and can be located year round with their heart-shaped leaves.
The flowers are barely noticeable. The wild ones are typically purple when ripe, though I have found some that are green when ripe. 

### Other
**Mayapple**
BE CAUTIOUS WITH THIS PLANT. EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE FULLY RIPE FRUIT IS TOXIC.
These large umbrella leaves stick straight out of the ground and are low down, with easy-to-miss white flowers which will be visible in May.
The fruits will not be edible until past May and into June or July. Only the soft, yellow, fragrant ripe fruits should be consumed.
The taste is wonderful, and I consider them worth the risk, as it is obvious when they are ripe. Unripe fruit is hard and green.

**Common Lambsquarters**
The edible leaves of this plant remind me of spinach, and it is easy to find pretty much anywhere on earth that is hospitable to large
populations of humans. The tops will look like they were dusted with white powder, which can be washed off but doesn't bother me. 
It can be harvested most of the year, though I think its freshest and best tasting in early spring. It grows like a weed,
because it is a common weed.
